                <h2>Electric Eel Sensor</h2><br>
                <h3><p>Electric Eel Sensor:</h3> The Electric Eel is a specialized sensor designed to measure underwater currents and changes in water conductivity. It emits electrical pulses and analyzes the return signals to determine the properties of the surrounding water.</p>
                <h3><p>Current Detection:</h3> By measuring the strength and direction of electric fields in the water, the Electric Eel can detect and track underwater currents, which can be crucial for understanding the dynamics of glacial lakes.</p>
                <h3><p>Conductivity Monitoring:</h3> Changes in water conductivity can indicate alterations in the lake's composition, such as the presence of suspended sediments or dissolved minerals. This information can be valuable for assessing the lake's overall health and potential hazards.</p>
                <h3><p>Data Integration:</h3> Complementary to Other Sensors: The Electric Eel's data complements the information gathered by the Penguin and other sensors. By combining data on water currents, conductivity, and lake levels, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the glacial lake's behavior. 
                <h3><p>Early Warning Systems:</h3> The Electric Eel's ability to detect changes in underwater currents can be particularly important for early warning systems. For example, if the sensor detects an increase in current velocity near a dam, it could indicate potential instability or erosion. Risk Assessment: By integrating data from multiple sensors, researchers can better assess the overall risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and develop more effective mitigation strategies.</p>
